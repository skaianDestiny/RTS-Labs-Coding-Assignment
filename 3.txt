3 If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

If I could change one thing about Java, I would make it so that primitives and arrays share more syntax and functions with objects.
The current way they are implemented means that, when creating a generic framework, you need to treat them special compared to any object classes.
For example, you must create two different functions if you want to compare an object to an int variable or a generic object variable.
The fact that Java has to have wrapper classes for primitives (such as the Integer class) in order to perform functions on them
makes it harder for beginner coders to understand what they are able to do with a variable. The disconnect between objects and primitives
can be highlighted with the way many new coders have issues with understanding how to compare two String objects (where a .equals() method is required)
as opposed to the simpler primitives which simply necessitate a "==" symbol.
